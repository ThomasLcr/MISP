/**
 * Section one of the Relationships tab: what the correlation engine
 * stored about this value.
 *
 * Machine-derived, statistical, and the only section that grows without
 * bound — so it is the only one that carries `R3`'s narrowing bar and
 * pages rather than caps. The cut is always stated in words above the
 * rows: a table that silently shows the top eight of 1,462 is a table
 * that lies by omission.
 *
 * Three things share this panel and are not the same thing:
 *
 *   object siblings   a join on `Attribute.object_id` over occurrences
 *                     the page already holds. Structural, not
 *                     statistical, and bounded by how many objects the
 *                     value sits in rather than by how large its events
 *                     are — which is why it still renders under a
 *                     suppressed band.
 *   the roll-ups      the neighbourhood, counted three ways.
 *   the facet bar     folded from every row read, not from the page.
 *                     Its counts do not move when the list pages, and
 *                     saying so is the whole reason the bar is here.
 *
 * **Not the correlation engine.** A `default_correlations` row links
 * two attributes carrying the *same* value, so for one value the engine
 * returns other occurrences of it — the Occurrences tab — and its
 * CIDR/ssdeep partners, which are the section below. It never returns a
 * different value. What is counted here is an event join, and the
 * engine's own state is reported on the rail instead.
